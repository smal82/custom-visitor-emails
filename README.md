Record and display visitor visits with date, time, IP and User-Agent.


# Info

The "Custom Visitor Emails" plugin allows you to record and view visitor visits to your site. Every time a user, excluding the admin, accesses the site, the plugin automatically records the date, time, IP address, and User-Agent of the visit. Visits are emailed to the admin and displayed in a dedicated table on the plugin page with a dedicated menu, along with date, time, IP address, and User-Agent details.

The plugin offers the possibility to empty the logged visits table, providing a simple and convenient management option. Furthermore, the plugin allows you to edit the robots.txt and .htaccess files in order to block all visits that the admin deems inappropriate.

An intuitive interface makes the "Custom Visitor Emails" plugin a useful tool for monitoring visitor activity on your WordPress site.
